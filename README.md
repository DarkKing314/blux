What BLUX is
------------
BLUX is an open, modular AI ecosystem built for next-generation automation, coding agents, and creative tools. It focuses on privacy, composability, and community governance. The system lets teams and individuals assemble agents and modules into pipelines that run locally or on trusted cloud nodes. BLUX balances pragmatic engineering with ethical controls so you can build automated workflows without sacrificing privacy or traceability.

Key principles
--------------
- Modular design: plug-in modules and agents communicate through clear interfaces and shared data contracts.  
- Privacy first: local execution and encrypted channels by default.  
- Community-led: contributions and governance follow open standards and clear review rules.  
- Ethical defaults: audit logs, rate limits, and human-in-the-loop controls built into runtime.  
- Interoperable: standard connectors for model runtimes, data stores, CI/CD, and observability.

Highlights
----------
- Agent runtime with lifecycle management and sandboxing.  
- Module registry with versioned interfaces.  
- End-to-end encrypted transport between nodes.  
- SDKs for Python and TypeScript.  
- CLI for local dev and deployment.  
- Policies and hooks for ethical constraints and audits.  
- Example projects: code-generation agent, creative-multimodal pipeline, automation templates.

Architecture overview
---------------------
BLUX follows a layered architecture:

1. Core runtime
   - Process manager, task queue, configuration store.
   - Enforces sandbox and resource limits.

2. Agent layer
   - Agents implement a standard Agent API.
   - Agents expose actions, capabilities, and consent hooks.

3. Module registry
   - Versioned modules (code, config, schema).
   - Module discovery and dependency resolution.

4. Connectors
   - Model runtimes, data stores, message brokers, observability sinks.

5. Control plane
   - Policy engine for ethical rules.
   - Audit trail and identity assertions.

6. CLI & SDKs
   - Dev tools to scaffold, test, and deploy agents and modules.

Images and assets
-----------------
Use the project art and space visuals to brand flows and demos:

- Demo UI mockups and icons live inside /assets in the repository.

Getting started (developer)
---------------------------
Clone the repo and run the local dev runner. The repo includes multiple modules and example agents.

Quick steps
1. Clone
   - git clone https://github.com/DarkKing314/blux.git
2. Install
   - Use the language-specific SDK in /sdk
3. Run
   - Use the CLI to start the runtime and register local modules

Install from Releases
---------------------
Download the latest release asset and run the installer to get a pre-built runtime and CLI. Follow these steps and replace names with the chosen release asset:

1. Download the installer from the Releases page:
   https://github.com/DarkKing314/blux/releases

2. Example shell steps (Linux/macOS):
   - curl -L -o blux-installer.sh "https://github.com/DarkKing314/blux/releases/download/latest/blux-installer.sh"
   - chmod +x blux-installer.sh
   - ./blux-installer.sh

The installer will unpack the runtime, place CLI binaries under /usr/local/bin or your home bin, and set up default config under ~/.blux. If you run the installer as non-root it will install to user space.

If you prefer containers, pull the official images from the registry and run the orchestrator with the provided compose files.

Core commands (CLI)
-------------------
- blux start         — start runtime in foreground  
- blux daemon        — run runtime as background service  
- blux agent list    — list registered agents  
- blux module add    — add module from registry or local path  
- blux run pipeline  — execute a pipeline definition  
- blux audit tail    — stream audit logs

SDK snippets
------------
Python (example agent registration)
```python
from blux.sdk import AgentClient

client = AgentClient.from_env()
agent = client.register(name="code-assist", version="0.1.0")
agent.declare_capability("codegen.v1")
agent.serve()
```

TypeScript (pipeline client)
```ts
import { PipelineClient } from "@blux/sdk";

const pc = new PipelineClient();
await pc.registerPipeline("demo", { nodes: [...] });
await pc.run("demo", { inputs: { repo: "git://..." }});
```

Examples and templates
----------------------
- examples/code-agent — an LLM-backed coding assistant that opens PRs with tests.  
- examples/creative-studio — multimodal pipeline combining images, audio, and text.  
- templates/automation — small automations that run scheduled checks and report to webhooks.  
- workshops/ethics-playbook — scenarios and test harness for ethical constraints.

Privacy and ethics
------------------
BLUX ships with safeguards:
- Default local-first execution for sensitive data.  
- Encrypted transport for inter-node messages.  
- Policy engine to enforce request-level rules and rate limits.  
- Audit logs that prove actions and approvals.  
- Human-in-the-loop gates on high-risk operations.

Governance and contribution model
---------------------------------
- Pull requests require a passing CI build and two approvals from maintainers or trusted contributors.  
- All changes to policy, audit, and core runtime follow a stricter review path.  
- Use the issue tracker to propose modules or architecture changes.  
- We maintain a public roadmap and changelog in /ROADMAP.md and /CHANGELOG.md.

Testing and CI
--------------
- Unit tests run under pytest (Python) and Jest (TypeScript).  
- Integration tests spin up a local test harness that simulates multiple nodes.  
- Security tests exercise the sandbox and policy paths.  
- Use blux test to run the full test matrix locally.

Observability
-------------
BLUX ships metrics and traces via Prometheus and OpenTelemetry hooks:
- Exporters for Prometheus, OTLP, and common APM providers.  
- Audit events stream to configurable sinks (file, syslog, cloud archive).  
- Runtime exposes a /metrics endpoint and a /health endpoint.

Common workflows
----------------
- Local dev: scaffold an agent, run unit tests, simulate inputs, iterate.  
- CI: build module, run static checks, run tests, publish artifact to registry.  
- Deployment: install runtime via the installer, register modules, and bootstrap policies.  
- Monitoring: connect Prometheus and set alerts for runtime errors and resource spikes.

Security model
--------------
- Sandbox each agent process with cgroups and namespaces.  
- Limit outbound network access by default; allow explicit connectors.  
- Sign modules and verify signatures at install time.  
- Rotate keys periodically and support hardware-backed key stores.

Module registry and versioning
------------------------------
- Registry stores modules with semantic versions.  
- Modules include metadata: capabilities, required connectors, and scopes.  
- The runtime resolves module dependencies and prevents conflicting interfaces.

Roadmap (high level)
--------------------
- Expand connectors for on-prem model runtimes and vector stores.  
- Harden the policy engine with more extensible rule sets.  
- Add richer orchestration primitives for long-running jobs.  
- Build community templates and certified modules.

Community and support
---------------------
- Open issues and pull requests on GitHub.  
- Community channels for discussion and governance proposals.  
- Maintainers tag issues with good-first-issue for newcomers.  
- Contribution guide lives in /CONTRIBUTING.md.
