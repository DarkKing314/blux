# BLUX

**The BLUX Project Umbrella**

---

**BLUX** is a modular, open-source ecosystem for next-generation AI-powered toolsâ€”local-first, privacy-respecting, and community-driven.  
This repository serves as the central hub and knowledge base for all BLUX projects, uniting advanced code agents, creative assistants, memory frameworks, and more.

---

## **Vision**

**BLUX** is dedicated to empowering individuals, developers, and communities to harness the power of modern AI without sacrificing privacy or independence.  
Our tools are designed to be plug-and-play, adaptable for any device, and free from paywalls or closed platforms.

---

## **Core Principles**

- **Local-First**: Use your own hardwareâ€”AI that lives and runs on your device.
- **Privacy & Security**: No user data leaves your device by default. Open-source by design.
- **Modular & Extensible**: Plug in new models, agents, and features as you wish.
- **Ethical by Default**: Strict policy against misuse, focused on creativity, education, and productivity.
- **Community-Guided**: Built for and with the communityâ€”contributors welcome at all levels.
