# ðŸ”’ BLUX Security Policy

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in BLUX or any of its subprojects (BLUX-cA, BLUX-Quantum, BLUX-Lite, Liberation Framework), please **do not** post it publicly.  
Instead, contact the maintainer directly:

- **Email:** theoutervoid@outlook.com

We will respond as quickly as possible and coordinate a fix before disclosure.

---

## Our Security Principles

- **Privacy-First:** All user data is local by default. We do not collect, transmit, or store user content without explicit consent.
- **Open Source:** All code is public, auditable, and open for review.
- **User Control:** Persistent memory (via Liberation Framework) is always user-authored and never retained by default.
- **Modular & Isolated:** Plugins and models should operate in sandboxed or clearly separated environments to minimize risk.
- **No Centralized Cloud:** BLUX core features never require centralized cloud storage, logins, or remote calls.

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_vulnerability_disclosure) best practices.  
If you report a valid security issue, we will:

- Acknowledge your report within 48 hours
- Work with you to resolve the vulnerability quickly
- Credit you (if you wish) in our release notes

---

## Supported Versions

We currently maintain the latest main branches of all BLUX projects.  
Older versions may not receive security patches.

---

## Community and Third-Party Plugins

While we encourage community plugins, all third-party code should be reviewed before installation.  
If you spot a security concern in a plugin, please notify both the BLUX maintainers and the plugin author.
