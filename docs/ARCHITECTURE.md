# BLUX Project Architecture

---

## **Ecosystem Overview**

BLUX unifies multiple modular AI projects under one umbrella.  
Each subproject is independently installable, but designed for seamless integration.

---

## **Core Patterns**

- **Modularity**: Projects are plug-and-play.
- **Local Execution**: Models run on user hardware unless otherwise noted.
- **Unified Memory/Plugin System**: Optional shared memory or plugin formats.
- **Common Policy/Ethics Framework**: All projects uphold privacy and ethical standards.

---

## **Example: Project Interactions**

- **BLUX-cA** can integrate with **BLUX-Quantum** as a plugin or be run standalone.
- **BLUX-Lite** serves as a reference for terminal/Android usability and lightweight agents.
- Shared cloud/plugin/memory frameworks are planned.
