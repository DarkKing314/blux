## What is the BLUX Ecosystem?

BLUX is more than just one projectâ€”it's a modular, extensible network of AI agents, developer tools, plugins, models, and frameworks, all designed for space-age creativity and user-first privacy.

- **BLUX-cA**: Main coding agent, the "hive mind"
- **BLUX-Quantum**: CLI shell and plugin platform
- **BLUX-Lite**: Lightweight terminal/Android agent
- **Liberation Framework**: User-defined persistent memory
- **Plugins/Models**: Extendable, swappable, future-proof

## Ecosystem Highlights

- **Modular**: Pick what you wantâ€”plug in and out, no lock-in
- **Community-driven**: Contributions, plugins, and models from anyone, anywhere
- **Roadmap-focused**: Constantly growing with clear goals
- **Documentation-first**: Every module, tool, and integration is documented
