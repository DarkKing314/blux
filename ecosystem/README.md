## üåå What is the BLUX Ecosystem?

BLUX is not just a project‚Äîit's a constellation of modular, local-first, privacy-focused AI tools designed for the next generation of developers, creators, and innovators.  
The ecosystem connects tools like BLUX-cA, BLUX-Quantum, and BLUX-Lite into a unified, future-forward AI platform.
