## 📦 Model Download & Installation

1. **Choose your model**: See the [download guides](download_guides.md) for size, features, and device compatibility.
2. **Download**: Follow the link and instructions for your chosen model.
3. **Store**: Place the downloaded files in your preferred location (SSD, SD card, cloud mount, etc.).
4. **Configure**: Update your BLUX tool (e.g., blux-ca) to point to your model directory.

**Note:** BLUX is local-first. Models are run on your own hardware, never streamed from a remote server.
