### 3. **/stubs or /planned/**
You can create empty or stub files for high-priority future models, e.g.:

- `CodeLlama.md`
- `DeepSeek.md`
- `StarCoder.md`
- `Llama3.md`
- etc.

Each stub just has a header and a “Coming Soon” notice (optional).

### 4. **models.md**  
An index/overview of all planned models (could be combined with README if you like).

### 5. **Folder Structure Example**

```
